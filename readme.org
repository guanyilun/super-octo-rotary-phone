* super-octo-rotary-phone
This is a julia learning project that implements a component
separation algorithm for CMB experiment in Julia -- sorry I wish it is
actually about a super octo rotary phone.

Currently, the code is able to produce the same result as fgbuster
with only 38 lines of code!

Now that I have had enough fun writing obscure codes, it's time to
rewrite it for performance, which is the next step.
